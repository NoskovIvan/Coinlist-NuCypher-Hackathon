The NuCypher network uses the Umbral_ threshold proxy re-encryption scheme
to provide cryptographic access controls for distributed apps and protocols.

1. Alice, the data owner, grants access to her encrypted data to
anyone she wants by creating a policy and uploading it to
the NuCypher network.

2. Using her policy's public key, any entity can encrypt data on Alice's behalf.
This entity could be an IoT device in her car, a collaborator assigned
the task of writing data to her policy, or even a third-party creating
data that belongs to her – for example, a lab analyzing medical tests.
The resulting encrypted data can be uploaded to IPFS, Swarm, S3,
or any other storage layer.

3. A group of Ursulas, which are nodes of the NuCypher network,
receive the access policy and stand ready to
re-encrypt data in exchange for payment in fees and token rewards.
Thanks to the use of proxy re-encryption,
Ursulas and the storage layer never have access to Alice's plaintext data.

4. Bob, a data recipient, sends an access request to the NuCypher network.
If the policy is satisfied, the data is re-encrypted to his public key
and he can decrypt it with his private key.
